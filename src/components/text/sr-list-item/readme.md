## Overview

List item, indended to be used within a List component
to adhere to a lists' style. if all we want to do is pad each item,
we can skip this comp and just use a box primitive to apply basic
positional styling
TODO ASK TONY. we probably dont need it unless list item requires
something other than basic margin/padding/alignment
